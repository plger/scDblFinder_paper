  {"id":"baisScdsComputationalAnnotation2020","abstract":"Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies enable the study of transcriptional heterogeneity at the resolution of individual cells and have an increasing impact on biomedical research. However, it is known that these methods sometimes wrongly consider two or more cells as single cells, and that a number of so-called doublets is present in the output of such experiments. Treating doublets as single cells in downstream analyses can severely bias a study’s conclusions, and therefore computational strategies for the identification of doublets are needed.With scds, we propose two new approaches for in silico doublet identification: Co-expression based doublet scoring (cxds) and binary classification based doublet scoring (bcds). The co-expression based approach, cxds, utilizes binarized (absence/presence) gene expression data and, employing a binomial model for the co-expression of pairs of genes, yields interpretable doublet annotations. bcds, on the other hand, uses a binary classification approach to discriminate artificial doublets from original data. We apply our methods and existing computational doublet identification approaches to four datasets with experimental doublet annotations and find that our methods perform at least as well as the state of the art, at comparably little computational cost. We observe appreciable differences between methods and across datasets and that no approach dominates all others. In summary, scds presents a scalable, competitive approach that allows for doublet annotation of datasets with thousands of cells in a matter of seconds.scds is implemented as a Bioconductor R package (doi: 10.18129/B9.bioc.scds).Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,12,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Bais","given":"Abha S"},{"family":"Kostka","given":"Dennis"}],"container-title":"Bioinformatics","container-title-short":"Bioinformatics","DOI":"10.1093/bioinformatics/btz698","ISSN":"1367-4803","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,2,15]]},"page":"1150-1158","source":"Silverchair","title":"scds: computational annotation of doublets in single-cell RNA sequencing data","title-short":"scds","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btz698","volume":"36"},
  {"id":"granjaArchRScalableSoftware2021","abstract":"The advent of single-cell chromatin accessibility profiling has accelerated the ability to map gene regulatory landscapes but has outpaced the development of scalable software to rapidly extract biological meaning from these data. Here we present a software suite for single-cell analysis of regulatory chromatin in R (ArchR; https://www.archrproject.com/) that enables fast and comprehensive analysis of single-cell chromatin accessibility data. ArchR provides an intuitive, user-focused interface for complex single-cell analyses, including doublet removal, single-cell clustering and cell type identification, unified peak set generation, cellular trajectory identification, DNA element-to-gene linkage, transcription factor footprinting, mRNA expression level prediction from chromatin accessibility and multi-omic integration with single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). Enabling the analysis of over 1.2 million single cells within 8 h on a standard Unix laptop, ArchR is a comprehensive software suite for end-to-end analysis of single-cell chromatin accessibility that will accelerate the understanding of gene regulation at the resolution of individual cells.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,2,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Granja","given":"Jeffrey M."},{"family":"Corces","given":"M.

  {"id":"kangMultiplexedDropletSinglecell2018","abstract":"Droplet single-cell RNA-sequencing (dscRNA-seq) has enabled rapid, massively parallel profiling of transcriptomes. However, assessing differential expression across multiple individuals has been hampered by inefficient sample processing and technical batch effects. Here we describe a computational tool, demuxlet, that harnesses natural genetic variation to determine the sample identity of each droplet containing a single cell (singlet) and detect droplets containing two cells (doublets). These capabilities enable multiplexed dscRNA-seq experiments in which cells from unrelated individuals are pooled and captured at higher throughput than in standard workflows. Using simulated data, we show that 50 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) per cell are sufficient to assign 97% of singlets and identify 92% of doublets in pools of up to 64 individuals. Given genotyping data for each of eight pooled samples, demuxlet correctly recovers the sample identity of >99% of singlets and identifies doublets at rates consistent with previous estimates. We apply demuxlet to assess cell-type-specific changes in gene expression in 8 pooled lupus patient samples treated with interferon (IFN)-β and perform eQTL analysis on 23 pooled samples.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,3,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Kang","given":"Hyun Min"},{"family":"Subramaniam","given":"Meena"},{"family":"Targ","given":"Sasha"},{"family":"Nguyen","given":"Michelle"},{"family":"Maliskova","given":"Lenka"},{"family":"McCarthy","given":"Elizabeth"},{"family":"Wan","given":"Eunice"},{"family":"Wong","given":"Simon"},{"family":"Byrnes","given":"Lauren"},{"family":"Lanata","given":"Cristina M."},{"family":"Gate","given":"Rachel E."},{"family":"Mostafavi","given":"Sara"},{"family":"Marson","given":"Alexander"},{"family":"Zaitlen","given":"Noah"},{"family":"Criswell","given":"Lindsey A."},{"family":"Ye","given":"Chun Jimmie"}],"container-title":"Nature Biotechnology","DOI":"10.1038/nbt.4042","ISSN":"1546-1696","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,1]]},"language":"en","page":"89-94","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Multiplexed droplet single-cell RNA-sequencing using natural genetic variation","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.4042","volume":"36"},
  {"id":"lutgeCellMixSQuantifyingVisualizing2021","abstract":"<p>A key challenge in single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data analysis is batch effects that can obscure the biological signal of interest. Although there are various tools and methods to correct for batch effects, their performance can vary. Therefore, it is important to understand how batch effects manifest to adjust for them. Here, we systematically explore batch effects across various scRNA-seq datasets according to magnitude, cell type specificity, and complexity. We developed a cell-specific mixing score (cms) that quantifies mixing of cells from multiple batches. By considering distance distributions, the score is able to detect local batch bias as well as differentiate between unbalanced batches and systematic differences between cells of the same cell type. We compare metrics in scRNA-seq data using real and synthetic datasets and whereas these metrics target the same question and are used interchangeably, we find differences in scalability, sensitivity, and ability to handle differentially abundant cell types. We find that cell-specific metrics outperform cell type–specific and global metrics and recommend them for both method benchmarks and batch exploration.</p>","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,6,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Lütge","given":"Almut"},{"family":"Zyprych-Walczak","given":"Joanna"},{"family":"Kunzmann","given":"Urszula Brykczynska"},{"family":"Crowell","given":"Helena L."},{"family":"Calini","given":"Daniela"},{"family":"Malhotra","given":"Dheeraj"},{"family":"Soneson","given":"Charlotte"},{"family":"Robinson","given":"Mark D."}],"container-title":"Life Science Alliance","DOI":"10.26508/lsa.202001004","ISSN":"2575-1077","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,6,1]]},"language":"en","PMID":"33758076","publisher":"Life Science Alliance","section":"Research Articles","source":"www.life-science-alliance.org","title":"CellMixS: quantifying and visualizing batch effects in single-cell RNA-seq data","title-short":"CellMixS","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.life-science-alliance.org/content/4/6/e202001004","volume":"4"},
  {"id":"xiBenchmarkingComputationalDoubletDetection2021","abstract":"In single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), doublets form when two cells are encapsulated into one reaction volume. The existence of doublets, which appear to be—but are not—real cells, is a key confounder in scRNA-seq data analysis. Computational methods have been developed to detect doublets in scRNA-seq data; however, the scRNA-seq field lacks a comprehensive benchmarking of these methods, making it difficult for researchers to choose an appropriate method for specific analyses. We conducted a systematic benchmark study of nine cutting-edge computational doublet-detection methods. Our study included 16 real datasets, which contained experimentally annotated doublets, and 112 realistic synthetic datasets. We compared doublet-detection methods regarding detection accuracy under various experimental settings, impacts on downstream analyses, and computational efficiencies. Our results show that existing methods exhibited diverse performance and distinct advantages in different aspects. Overall, the DoubletFinder method has the best detection accuracy, and the cxds method has the highest computational efficiency.
