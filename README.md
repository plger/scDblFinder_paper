# scDblFinder paper

This is the code & data behind the [scDblFinder paper](https://f1000research.com/articles/10-979/v1).

For the `scDblFinder` package itself, visit the package's [github page](https://github.com/plger/scDblFinder) or 
[Bioconductor vignette](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/scDblFinder/inst/doc/scDblFinder.html).

The manuscript source file, including the code to generate the main figures, can be found in [paper/scDblFinder.Rmd](paper/scDblFinder.Rmd).
Supplementary Figures are generated in [paper/supplementaries.Rmd](paper/supplementaries.Rmd), and a rendered version is available in [paper/supplementaries.pdf](paper/supplementaries.pdf).
Other folders contain analyses whose results are then used by those files.
